### The list of domains

This is the list of all the domains I have and why I use them / there story.

## Domains

- https://aidanbennett.me - This is used for my personal website which shows a bit of info about me on it.
- https://aidan.to - This was going to be used for a URL shortener however I didn't use it for that. Instead I used it for trafik and wireguard. I do plan to use the root domain to be a URL shortener still.
- https://aidan.click - This was also going to be a URL shortener however, I found out that https://aidan.to was available and thought it sounded nicer. 
- https://starnod.es - This domain is used to point at some servers I own so I don't have to remember the ip address of the server. The root domain also has a rick roll on it.
- https://notarickrolliswear.com - This domain was brought just to host a rick roll on.
- https://cryptochord.xyz - This was to host a frontend for a discord bot I started making however I got bored and forgot about it until now.
- https://kryptonmc.dev - This is a active project I am working on which is for a plugin repository for the Minecraft server software called Krypton.
