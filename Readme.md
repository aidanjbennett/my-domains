### What is this

My name is Aidan Bennet I am a small developer located in England, UK. I have a bad habit of buying domains which I don't use. I am using this to keep accountability of using the domains I buy. If I buy any domains which I don't use I want you to message me on discord ()or tweet me. This list is NOT to flex my ability to afford these domains its just for YOU to keep me accountable for not using all of them.

## Where can I follow you / tell you to stop buying domains?
